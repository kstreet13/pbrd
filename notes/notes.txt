----------
Based on plots.zip from my 2024-01-10 email
6 and 8 are transition group, only present in experimental group
Want to add marker genes to dot plot to show the destination
Mecom is a new gene important for directing blood vessels
Remove duplicate gene Mecom
5+11 might be blood vessels
13+1 -> 6+8 -> 5+11 ???
Want to identify clusters based on endothelial markers
Brandon will provide updated list of marker genes

(Cluster numbers no longer relevant)
